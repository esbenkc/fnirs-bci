Assessing the benefit of pre-training with an LSTM. Specifically, I pre-train a machine learning model self-supervised (LeCun & Misra, 2021) using the LSTM architecture (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) on functional near-infrared spectroscopic (fNIRS) neuroimaging data (Naseer & Hong, 2015) from the NIRx NIRSport2 system (NIRx, 2021) and transfer and fine-tune it for a BCI thought classification task (Yoo et al., 2018) as is done with language models (C. Sun et al., 2019). As far as I know, this is the first example of such work.

## Meta
- ðŸ“œ Is part of the thesis project for [Esben Kran](https://kran.ai)
- ðŸ•¸ Scientific interest is to alleviate problems of signal instability, low signal/noise ratio and long initial adaptation time in brain-computer interfaces
  - Basic improvements in BCI thought classification accuracy can lead to downstream improvements in all parts of the BCI pipeline for clinical and retail use cases
- ðŸ”¨ The practical interest is to learn how to build a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) using the [NIRSport2](https://nirx.net/nirsport) with deep learning
